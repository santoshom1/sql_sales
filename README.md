## Actionable Insights and Recommendations:
- From the count of orders as per state record it has been observed that SP state has highest number of orders overall , therefore focusing more on this state like giving them reasonable offers and monthly subscription would make them engage more on target platform and orders will flow accordingly
- As per the payment type wise number of orders, it has been observed that number of orders using debit card are very less , here what we can offer is giving some discount on using specific debit cards will help the orders grow and also by partnering up with debit card companies will benefit Target more.
- The states RR , PB and RO has the highest freight value which will increase cost to company, here we can increase inventory so that freight value can reduced and that money can be used in marketing strategies.
- Implement the same strategies used in SP state for RR, AP and AC states will increase the sales more.
